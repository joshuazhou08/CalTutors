const danielIntro = `Hi! My name is Daniel, and I am a rising second-year. As I continued to 
master my writing skills through AP exams, college applications, and essays during my freshman year of college, 
I gained valuable insights into what can elevate a studentâ€™s writing from satisfactory to excellent. My main focus 
as your writing tutor is to ignite your intellectual fire, to give your writing ideas a deeper layer of nuance. 
Then, I will teach you how to execute these ideas with effective rhetoric. In my free time, I like to play 
pickleball and chess. I look forward to working with you!`
